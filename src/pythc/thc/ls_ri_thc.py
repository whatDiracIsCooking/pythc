class LS_RI_THC(THC):
    """

    This class implements Least-Squares Fitted THC following Hohenstein, Parrish, Martinez
    (DOI: 10.1063/1.4768233) sometimes also referred to as Interpolative Separable Density Fitting (ISDF)
    (see Lee, Lin, Head-Gordon (2020 - DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00820)).

    This abstract base class establishes the framework for LS-THC. It relies on density
    fitting (resolution of the identity) to factorize the electron repulsion integrals.
    The Coulomb kernel (Z) is constructed via an intermediate tensor (D), such that
    Z = D.T @ D. Subclasses must implement the `build_pruned_X` method to define the
    grid selection strategy.

        Workflow summary:
        1. Grid Pruning (`build_pruned_X`): Selects a representative subset of grid points

        2. 2-Center Integrals: Evaluates the auxiliary basis 2-center integrals (K|L)
           and computes their inverse square root.
        3. Intermediate Matrix Construction:
           - In 'ao' mode (`build_D_ao`): Computes the metric inversion directly,
             contracts 3-center integrals with the AO collocation pair products using
             spatial symmetry, and multiplies by the 2-center inverse.
           - In 'ov' mode (`build_D_ov`): Projects X into the MO basis, isolates the
             occupied and virtual blocks to compute the metric inversion, contracts
             with 3-center integrals, and multiplies by the 2-center inverse.
